# Structural-Element-Identification

The construction industry is the main contributor to global greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions, resource consumption and demolition-related waste generation.
A reduction in these environmental impacts can be achieved by recovering
building waste through selective deconstruction and material reuse.

The built environment can take advantage of circular economy and digitalization
principles to promote reuse practices. However, the absence of an established
decision-making framework to identify reusable structural elements and the lack
of initiatives to adopt advanced technologies for reuse slow down the practical
implementation in the built environment.
